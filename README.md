# mlflow-postgres-minio
Automatic setup of a MLflow server. This includes a Postgres database, to store MLflow metadata such as experiment data, run data, and model registry data. In addition we will also configure Minio, an open-source object storage system, to store and retrieve large files such as model artifacts and data sets.
